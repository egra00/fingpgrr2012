This example demonstrates the use of MIRA algorithm.

The topology is taken from 
   "Minimum Interference Routing with Applications to MPLS Traffic Engineering"
    Murali Kodialam, T.V. Lakshman
    INFOCOM 2000

The scenario files uses the "pathRelativeTo" attribute of the scenario XML element.

Included files:
---------------

MIRA.xml: define a simple topology. Some nodes are defined as CORE while others are EDGE nodes.

MIRA-scenario.xml: Scenario consisting in establishing two lsps on the topology with newMIRA.
    
HopCount-scenario.xml: Same scenario but using CSPF hop count. In this scenario, one of the two LSPs cannot establish.
