trafficSwitching.xml
====================

Shows how traffic switching works.

An LSP is established between S and D
A global backup is calculated for it.

Traffic is routed from S to D using Basic IGP shortcut. It uses the primary LSP.
When a link of the primary fails, the traffic is switched to the backup lsps,
because traffic switching was enabled.

If traffic switching was not enabled, the primary couldn't be used and 
the traffic would have followed a path calculated by CSPF.
