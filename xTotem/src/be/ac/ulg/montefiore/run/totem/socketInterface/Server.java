/**
*
* Wait for clients on a socket interface.
* Receives scenario events from the socket interface, treat them and sends responses.
*<p>
* A call to start(.) method will create a new thread that waits for clients and a "consumer" to execute received
* scenario events.<br>
* When a client is connected, a "producer" thread is launched. It reads messages coming from socket and puts them in a
* queue. The consumer executes the events from the queue and sends the response to the client.<p>
*
* note: Multiple clients can be enabled by removing the call to producerThread.join() in the start method. but this was not tested.<br>
* note: Does not seem to stop correctly.
