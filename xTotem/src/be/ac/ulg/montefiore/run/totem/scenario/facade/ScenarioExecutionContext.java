/**
* This class is used by scenario events to identify the context on which they are executed
* (from which path relative paths should be interpreted). This is used because scenario events do not have a reference
* to the scenario to which they belong.
* <p/>
* The context is set by the scenario manager and suppose that only one scenario is executed at a time.
